The installation of these libraries can be done by hand on desktop machines or using modules on HPC environments\r\n#### Ubuntu/Debian Linux\r\nSince Ubuntu 14.04LTS, the system libraries can be used:\r\n```bash\r\nsudo apt-get install gfortran libnetcdff5 libfftw3-dev libblas3 openmpi-bin gfortran\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### MacOS X\r\nWe recommend using Homebrew to download and compile the necessary libraries. Be careful to add the *--with-fortran* argument while installing any library. Otherwise, only C libraries are installed. If you did install the libraries before without the *--with-fortran* argument, it may be necessary to remove and reinstall them.\r\n\r\n#### HPC environments\r\nBe sure to load modules for Fortran, NetCDF, FFTW and LAPACK.\r\nOn SuperMUC, the necessary commands are\r\n```\r\nmodule load fortran\r\nmodule load netcdf/4.2\r\nmodule load fftw\r\nmodule load mkl\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nChange into the download directory and copy the included template files into the main directory\r\n```bash\r\ncd kerner\r\n./copy_templates.sh\r\n```\r\nThe file *make_mc_kerner.macros* allows you to modify the compiler name and compiler flags according to your system. To compile, use make\r\n```bash\r\nmake \r\n```\r\nand \r\n```bash\r\nmake test \r\n```\r\nto run a set of tests.\r\n\r\n## FAQs\r\n### Anaconda interference \r\nThe python package manager Anaconda installs his own version of gfortran, which interferes with the system version and the MPI libraries. \r\nA solution is to replace the compiler name *FC* and the *MPIRUN* variable in *make_mc_kerner.macros* with absolute paths\r\n```bash\r\nFC = /usr/bin/mpif90\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
