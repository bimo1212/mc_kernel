## Download
To download the current developer version, use git clone
```
git clone https://github.com/sstaehler/kerner
```

## Prequisites
MC Kernel needs a recent Fortran compiler (gfortran 4.8 or later), the NetCDF library for accessing the wavefield files, the FFTW library for Fourier transforms and LAPACK, because we were too lazy to write a matrix inversion routine ourselves. The installation of these libraries can be done by hand on desktop machines or using modules on HPC environments
### Ubuntu/Debian Linux
Since Ubuntu 14.04LTS, the system libraries can be used:
```
sudo apt-get install libnetcdff5 libfftw3-dev libblas3
```

### MacOS X
We recommend using Homebrew to download and compile the necessary libraries. Be careful to add the *--with-fortran* argument while installing any library. Otherwise, only C libraries are installed. If you did install the libraries before without the --with-fortran argument, it may be necessary to remove and reinstall them.

### HPC environments
Be sure to load modules for NetCDF, FFTW and LAPACK
On SuperMUC, the necessary commands are
```
module load netcdf/4.2
module load fftw
module load mkl
```
