 - fft type should be generic

 - normalization of fft with sampling rate dt do avoid problems when using fft for
   convolutions

 - tidy up specialized npol=4 functions if not used

 - check sampling of the wavefields vs source time function an others: does it include
   time zero?? related to this: nstrain in nc_routines assumes the first dump is after dt,
   not at zero
   one consequence: the peak of the stf is not at the location indicated by time_shift
   also, the variable snapshot_times in the netcdf output does not start at 0, but the
   snapshots do. the values seem to be off anyway (yes, the whole source stuff is a
   complete mess)
